# Amazon Sales Data Readme

# Objective:
Segement e-commerce customers into distinct behavioral groups to support targeted marketing, personalization and retition strategies.

Clustering will be performed in two ways:
1: Purchase-behavior clustering (overall behavior, ignoring time)

Goal: Identify customer groups based purely on what and how they buy, regardless of when they buy. 

Value (Behavioral):
- Target Promotions
- Identify Churn-Risk Customers
- Improve loyalty programs

2: Seasonality-aware clustering (monthly purchasing patterns)

Goal: Cluster customers based on when they buy rather than just how much they buy.

Value (Temporal):
- Seasonal marketing campaigns
- Inventory forecasting
- Timing promotions correctly
